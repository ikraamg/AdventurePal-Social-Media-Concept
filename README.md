This project was built from a wireframe and a few design images to create a fully coded webpage:

- Three pages were designed, each in mobile and then a desktop version:

1. The person detail [index page](https://ikraamg.github.io/AdventurePal-Social-Media-Concept/index.html) that links to the chat page via the messages icon on the left. Or the picture of the message at the bottom right.

2. The [chat page](https://ikraamg.github.io/AdventurePal-Social-Media-Concept/chats.html), with a list of chats that link to the chat detail page by clicking any chat.

3. The [messages page](https://ikraamg.github.io/AdventurePal-Social-Media-Concept//messages.html) which can be returned from by clicking the left/back arrow on the top left.

- A media query breakpoint was used at 1024px, as requested by the project plan.
- The responsiveness was checked that it did not break on very small or large screens.
- CSS Grid and Flex were used for the layouts.
- SASS was used for styling.
